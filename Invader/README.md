# Setup Instructions

It seems that `npm` (Node Package Manager) is not installed or not available in your PATH. This project requires Node.js to run.

## 1. Install Node.js
Please download and install Node.js from the official website:
https://nodejs.org/

We recommend the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version.

## 2. Verify Installation
After installation, open a new terminal (or restart your computer) and run:
```powershell
node -v
npm -v
```
You should see version numbers for both.

## 3. Run the Project
Once Node.js is installed, you can run the game with:
```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```
